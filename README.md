# QuadraticFunction_AA
This is a program that draws quadratic functions with Anti-Aliasing. Also, dont be surprised to see that the code is not on the gratest level as I'm still a begginer...

To use program:
1. Install all dependencies like, SDL2 library for c language.
2. Change "a", "b" and "c" variables as you like (with notation a*x^2 + b*x + c).
3. Have fun looking at beautiful functions in range to 10!
